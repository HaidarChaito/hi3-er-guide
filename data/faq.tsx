      'What does the Ranking at the top and the Stars at the bottom in the Valkyries cards mean, and what is the difference?',
    multi_lines: [
      'Top Ranking represents what rank the Valkyrie should be in order to work with a comfortable performance. If the Rank is not met, you can expect the performance to not be as good, however, at lower difficulties this becomes more forgiving and it is not as much of a problem to be ranked lower, as long as the gap is not too big',
      'The Stars based ranking on the bottom represents the general performance and strength of the Valkyrie for the Current Patch. The higher the stars, the stronger they are. Always use the strongest ones if you are looking for Weekly Clear.',

      'Blood rose gives the biggest buff to your damage amongst the available supports and synergize well with Kalpas signets by lowering your HPs',
      'Generally valkyries who runs Kalpas 1 as their first choice are recommended to lower their HP before entering any floor with high HPs to benefit from Kalpas signets',
      'You can also do it on the shop floor, as interacting with the shop reset your support(s) cooldown!',

    question: 'What does the Build 1 or 2 means?',
    multi_lines: [
      'Build 1 means only the first build to the left takes that specific load out, if it is listed as 1/2 means both build 1 AND build 2 takes and so on.',

    question:
      'There is a Star based Ranking for the Valkyries build as well. What is the difference for these and what does it mean?',
    multi_lines: [
      'The Star Ranking for a Valkyrie builds indicates how strong the build is.',
      'For Valkyries that have 2 or 3 builds available to them, this also directly translates into which build is stronger over the other.',

    multi_lines: [
      'There are many variables. It can be Skill issue (Having what has been proven and tested to be enough and yet failing in this)',
      'Gameplay issue (not following the given Sequence for the Valkyrie and build or doing it badly)',

    question:
      'I do not want to play with Kalpas signets because I always die or being at low HP is not comfortable for me. Is it necessary?',
    multi_lines: [
      'Some Valkyries, or Valkyries with certain Builds HAVE a warning regarding the usage of Kalpas.',

    multi_lines: [
      'Vill-V for everyone, she is the easiest to kill. Next easiest is Aponia, specially if Mech Valk.',
